# Using the DAPNET Paging Gateway

Sending a person a page is accomplished by DMR ID. This was the most universally accessible way to make this work (see the FAQ's for more information).

To use the gateway, dial ```327638``` (spells DAPNET on the phone dialpad) and then follow the voice prompts:

* ```At the Beep, enter the DMR ID of the person you wish to contact and then press the pound key``` - At the beep, dial the DMR ID of the person.
* ```At the beep, please enter your callback number and then press the pound key.``` - at the beep, enter the number you want the person to call you back at. This can be your Ham VOIP extension (Ham's Over IP, AmateurWire, Hamshack Hotline or OARC) or an actual PSTN number. 

A page will then be sent to the person and be formatted as ```Yourcallsign: Call me at YourCallbackNumber```

* Example: ```N8ACL: Call me at 8675309```

At the end, the call will automatically hangup.
